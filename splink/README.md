# Explore Splink

Splink provides a very comprehensive and digestible document. Here's the link [document](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html)

In our task, we use splink to conduct the efficient big-data fuzzy matching. Since we can split the dataset by blocking rules (highlight of splink package), in each matching process, we do not go through all the dataset.

## Tutorials and Examples
- Linking two tables of persons by Splink [splink example](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/example_link_only.html) 
- A trial based on our own dataset (dataset omitted) [explore splink](https://github.com/ZhimingMei/Big-Data-Matching/blob/main/splink/explore_splink.ipynb)
